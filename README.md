# ServiceMapper-Pro
A deep-dive service enumeration and OS fingerprinting project built on Nmap for comprehensive network reconnaissance. ServiceMapper Pro leverages advanced scanning techniques to precisely identify running services, their versions, and the underlying operating systems on a target host, providing critical intelligence for vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

Features
Comprehensive Service Detection: Uses Nmap's powerful service detection (-sV) to identify specific software and version numbers for each open port.

Operating System Fingerprinting: Employs OS detection (-O) with guessing to determine the target's platform and kernel version.

Stealthy Scanning: Utilizes SYN stealth scanning (-sS) for efficient and less intrusive discovery.

Aggressive Discovery: Bypasses host discovery with -Pn and name resolution with -n for focused, faster results on known targets.

Full Port Range Analysis: Scans all TCP ports to uncover even hidden or uncommon services.

Detailed Reporting: Provides a clean, parsed output that maps ports to services, versions, and potential vulnerabilities.

Installation & Prerequisites
ServiceMapper Pro is a methodology built on the industry-standard Nmap tool.

Install Nmap:
On Kali Linux / Debian-based systems:

bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap
On macOS (using Homebrew):

bash
brew install nmap
On Windows:
Download the installer from the official Nmap website.

Clone this Repository (Optional - for scripts and docs):

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ServiceMapper-Pro.git
cd ServiceMapper-Pro
Usage
The core of this project is the sophisticated Nmap command. The provided syntax is optimized for maximum information gathering.

The Core Command
Run the comprehensive scan to map all services and the OS.

bash
sudo nmap -Pn -n -sS 192.168.14.129 -sV -O --osscan-guess
sudo: Often required for SYN scans and detailed OS fingerprinting.

-Pn: Treats all hosts as online (skips host discovery).

-n: Skips DNS resolution for faster scanning.

-sS: TCP SYN stealth scan. Efficient and relatively quiet.

192.168.14.129: The target IP address.

-sV: Probes open ports to determine service/version info.

-O: Enables OS detection.

--osscan-guess: Makes a best effort at OS detection when perfect matching isn't possible.

Practical Examples
Save results to a file:

bash
sudo nmap -Pn -n -sS 192.168.14.129 -sV -O --osscan-guess -oA servicemapper_scan
# This creates three files: servicemapper_scan.nmap, .xml, and .gnmap
Scan a range of hosts:

bash
sudo nmap -Pn -n -sS 192.168.14.0/24 -sV -O --osscan-guess
Example Output & Analysis
The scan reveals a rich attack surface, often uncovering a mix of modern and legacy services:

text
PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
21/tcp   open  ftp        vsftpd 2.3.4
22/tcp   open  ssh        OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1
23/tcp   open  telnet     Linux telnetd
25/tcp   open  smtp       Postfix smtpd
53/tcp   open  domain     ISC BIND 9.4.2
80/tcp   open  http       Apache httpd 2.2.8 ((Ubuntu) DAV/2)
3306/tcp open  mysql      MySQL 5.0.51a-3ubuntu5
5432/tcp open  postgresql PostgreSQL DB 8.3.0 - 8.3.7
5900/tcp open  vnc        VNC (protocol 3.3)
6667/tcp open  irc        UnrealIRCd
8180/tcp open  http       Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1
...
OS details: Linux 2.6.9 - 2.6.33
This output immediately flags outdated and notoriously vulnerable software like vsftpd 2.3.4 and UnrealIRCd for further investigation.

Project Script
Create a simple Bash script (servicemapper.sh) to automate the scan.

bash
#!/bin/bash

# servicemapper.sh - The ServiceMapper Pro wrapper script
TARGET=$1
OUTPUT_PREFIX="servicemap_$TARGET"

echo "[+] Starting ServiceMapper Pro against $TARGET"
echo "[+] Command: sudo nmap -Pn -n -sS $TARGET -sV -O --osscan-guess -oA $OUTPUT_PREFIX"

sudo nmap -Pn -n -sS $TARGET -sV -O --osscan-guess -oA $OUTPUT_PREFIX

echo "[+] Scan complete. Results saved to: $OUTPUT_PREFIX.nmap"
Make it executable and run it:

bash
chmod +x servicemapper.sh
./servicemapper.sh 192.168.14.129
